Persistent binary search tree implementation in Python. This is an example of [persistent data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure). The implementation is based on the algorithm from [Sleator, Tarjan et al.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/making-data-structures-persistent.pdf).
